# DiRT - The Digital Radio Toolkit
DiRT provides low level primitives to help design generic Digital Radios for ASIC and FPGA implementations.

## DRaT - Digital Radio Transport
DRat is a simple packet based protocol for both NoC use on device and transport between ASIC/FPGA and compute hosts via other encapsulating transport protocols.
